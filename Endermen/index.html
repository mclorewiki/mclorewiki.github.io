				<h2>Taxonomy</h2>
				<p>
					<a href="/Taxonomy/">Taxonomically</a>, Endermen are considered to be part of the Hominin family, closely related to Humans and distantly related to Testificates, <br>
					this is evidenced by their anthropomorphic stature, abilities of speech, and building ability, which suggest high cognitive thought and a close relation to Humans. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The validity of this relationship is enforced by the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Minecraft-Mobestiary-official-book-Mojang/dp/1405286024/">Mobestiary</a>, which show's the peculiar similiarties between the Enderman and Human neurocranium. <sup><a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/minecraft_gamepedia/images/d/dd/Enderman_Mobestiary.jpg" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup> 
				</p>
			</section>
			
			<section id="Occurence">
				<h2>Occurence</h2>
				<p>
					Endermen can be found in each of the Three Dimenions (those being the End, Nether, and Overworld), <sup><a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/meet-enderman" target="_blank">[2]</a></sup> <br>
					it's unknown if these are examples of Endermen living in different habitats or if Endermen are capable of inter-dimensional travel and are simply passing through worlds temporarily. 
				</p>
			</section>
			
			
			<section id="Biology">
				<h2>Biology</h2>
				
				<h3>Anatomy</h3>
				<p>Endermen possess 4 appendages, those being 2 arms and 2 legs, as well as a pair of wide-set eyes, an unhingeable jaw, a central torso, a symmetrical body plan, and a central nervous system. <sup><a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/minecraft_gamepedia/images/d/dd/Enderman_Mobestiary.jpg" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup> </p>
				
				<h3>Body</h3>
				<p>
					Their appendages are extremely long, making up most of the length of their body, enabling them to more easily harvet "Chorus Fruit", <br>
					which is said to be their favourite fruit<sup><a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/taking-inventory--chorus-fruit" target="_blank">[3]</a></sup>, and being the only obvious food-source in the End, most likely makes up a vast portion of their natural diet, <br>
					it's unknown how this applies to those found in dimensions other than the End in the case that these are distinct habitats. 
				</p>
				
				<h3>Eyes</h3>
				<p>Endermen's eyes have a wider surface area than most other creatures, giving them a greater feild of vision, and a larger sclera ("eye-white"). </p>
				<p>Their eyes are seen in purple when they are alive, but become green upon their death, it's unknown what causes this change in colour. </p>
				<p>
					Endermen have a strong aversion to eye-contact, at least with humans, and will become extremely upset and hostile towards those who look them in the eye directly, <br>
					accompanied with violent screaming, as though they're being (psychologically) damaged. 
				</p>
				
				<h3>Mandible</h3>
				<p>
					Endermen possess and unhingeable jaw which can extend to be equal to their cranium (upper skull) in length, this is commonly used in an extreme form of teeth-baring, <br>
					as a means of showing aggression in an attempt to strike fear into the intended viewer.

			<section id="Behaviour">
				<h2>Behaviour</h2>
				
				<h3>Adversion to water</h3>
				<p>Endermen are strongly adversed to water, being even partially submerged causes them extreme physical damage. </p>
				<p>In the event of a rainstorm, Endermen will teleport sporadically in search of cover. </p>
				
				<h3>Aversion to eye-contact</h3>
				<p><i>No further information. </i></p>
				
				<h3>Vocalization</h3>
				<p>Endermen have very advanced vocal abilities, and are capable of a form of speech which is partially mutually-intelligable with human speech. </p>
				<p>Endermen appear to have very limited set of vocalizations, suggesting they don't pay much importance to vocal communication, or lack the mental ability to form unique vocalizations</p>
